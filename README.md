##  What is Affine Transformation?

Affine Transformation is a linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes. Common operations include:

| Operation   | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Translation | Moves the image along X and/or Y direction    |
| Rotation    | Rotates the image by a certain angle          |
| Scaling     | Enlarges or shrinks the image                 |
| Shearing    | Tilts the image along X or Y axis             |

These are done using **transformation matrices** and `cv2.warpAffine()` function in OpenCV.
